# Bluesky Scanner - Project Complete! 🎉

## Overview
Successfully created a fully functional Bluesky scanner application using Electron and TypeScript that allows users to find people and organizations to follow on Bluesky.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- **Bluesky Authentication**: Secure login using @atproto/api
- **Enhanced Search**: Three search modes with filter dropdown:
  - Combined: Searches both profiles and content
  - Profiles Only: Searches user profiles specifically
  - Content Only: Searches post content
- **Profile Viewer**: Click on any user card to view detailed profile information and recent posts
- **Username Memory**: Application remembers the last username used for convenience

### Technical Implementation
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with gradient backgrounds, card layouts, and smooth animations
- **Security**: Proper Content Security Policy, sandboxed renderer, IPC communication
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between main process (API calls) and renderer (UI)
- **Build System**: Complete npm scripts for development and distribution

## 🚀 Working Executable
The application has been successfully built into a working Windows executable:
- Location: `app/dist-electron/win-unpacked/Bluesky Scanner.exe`
- Status: Fully functional with all features working
- Dependencies: All properly bundled (including @atproto/api)

## 📁 Repository Status
- **Git Repository**: Properly organized at workspace level
- **Version Control**: Clean state with build artifacts excluded
- **Documentation**: Complete with architecture diagrams and plans in `copilot/` directory

## 🛠️ Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd app && npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for distribution
npm run build
npm run dist
```

## 📋 Distribution Notes
- Code signing requires Windows symbolic link privileges (see DISTRIBUTION.md)
- Current executable works perfectly without signing
- ASAR disabled for easier debugging and dependency resolution
